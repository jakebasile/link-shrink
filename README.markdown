#Link Shrink Readme
Thanks for checking out **Link Shrink**. I wrote this app because I wanted to learn how to write Android apps. It is a simple link shortener that can be activated from many places in Android. You can long press on the browser's URL bar and select Share, or select Share from the browser menu. It also works with the Youtube app and others. When it is done shortening the link, it is copied to the clipboard. You can select from is.gd, bit.ly, or goo.gl. Bit.ly has account support through their API.

The app is available to download from the [Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.jakebasile.android.urlshortener), or by [direct download](http://code.jakebasile.com/link-shrink/downloads/Link-Shrink.apk).

##How To Use
I've tried to keep this app very simple, to match its very simple purpose. You can download the app and it will "just work" with is.gd. If you'd like to change what shortening service it uses, simply open the Link Shrink icon from the launcher.

##Issues
To report an issue, you can [email me](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=011BdB4u1pCLhbUGkJmJVitQ==&c=p-7aRIWqHdpoJP_GrxXH6linWktSJeucW28Fjrj1RSI=) to try to solve it or create a new [issue](http://code.jakebasile.com/linkshrink/issues) - after checking to see that it isn't already there. I will try to fix it soon, but please consider that this project is not my day job. If you really want something fixed and you know how to code, you can try doing it yourself and getting into contact with me to add in your changes.

##A Brief Note on Convoluted Changelogs
I also started this project to teach myself how to use a DVCS such as Mercurial. I have no experience with these and have made some mistakes. Try to ignore them and let me sweep them under the rug, ok?
