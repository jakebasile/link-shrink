# Link Shrink Pro Readme

# **NOTICE**: I am no longer maintaining Link Shrink. The APIs it uses have decayed, and I no longer want to encourage short links.

Thanks for checking out **Link Shrink Pro**. I wrote this app because I wanted to learn how to write Android apps. It is a simple link shortener that can be activated from many places in Android. You can long press on the browser's URL bar and select Share, or select Share from the browser menu. It also works with the Youtube app and others. When it is done shortening the link, it is copied to the clipboard. You can select from is.gd, bit.ly, or goo.gl. Bit.ly has account support through their API.
